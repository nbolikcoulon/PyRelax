# PyRelax

PyRelax is intended to be a Python library to compute Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spin relaxation rates in the frame of the Redfield theory, with a focus on biologically relevant spin systems.

The current version contains modules necessary to describe the spin system, define spin operators, state operators, and Basis operator sets.
